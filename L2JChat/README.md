## Purpose
This application is meant to supplement non-Japanese client versions of L2 - allowing users to type/communicate in Japanese without taking away from their game experience.

## Requirements 
Windows
.Net 6 Framework (will be installed automatically during setup)

## Installation
Use this [setup.exe](https://github.com/MoetsukiOtoko/L2JChat/blob/master/published/setup.exe?raw=true) located within this repository.
The application is not certified with Microsoft SmartScreen so it will produce this warning.
